This package is an experimental work-in-progress successor to [{a11ytables}](https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/).

There's no guarantee that this package will work during development. There may be several 'hanging branches' for experimentation.

The plan is for {a11ytables2} to:

* be built on [{openxlsx2}](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/) instead of {openxlsx}
* start with a more flexible input system based on lists, making it easier to add arbitrary pre-table metadata, include multiple tables per sheet, etc
* take advantage of a 'YAML blueprint' system for data input via a text file
* take advantage of tools like {cli} and {fs} for better messaging and file handling

You should use {a11ytables} until {a11ytables2} is stable (which may never happen).
